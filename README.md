# Iris Flower Classification System 😄

## Description
<b>
Iris flower classification is a very popular machine learning project. 
The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 
4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’.
</b><br> <br>

## Objectives
The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.<br><br>
